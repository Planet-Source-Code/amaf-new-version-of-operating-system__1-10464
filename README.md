## new version of operating system


</div>

### Description

i added a few more programs like aol, help, and error messages. this is a small windows. it has a working menu, working taskbar, working startmenu, working programs, working drap&drop, working recycle bin, working desktop. download it and use it to release your own type of small os. edit the source to make it more powerful. don't believe this is going to totally replace windows, it's just a little project that's fun to work on.
